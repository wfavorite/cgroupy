# cgroupy

A (public) PoC / discovery project for the kind of tool development I might be called to create.

I wrote it to polish up on some skills. This is not for public use, unless the use is to read my work / style.

> __NOTE__
>> This is NOT a complete implementation - just kicking around some concepts. This is not to be used in a production environment or under production conditions.

## About

This is a (wrapper around a) class to read in cgroup configurations. Potential uses are for off-system QC or comparisons / deltas with other system configurations.

At this point it is just a day-ish of work, so is __far from complete__ with minimal test coverage.
